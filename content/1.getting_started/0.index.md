### How It Works?

At a high level, **ESP Admin** is composed of a full-stack web **Application** and a firmware **SDK**. It follows an event driven architecture via MQTT protocol where the **Broker** is user defined.

Two types of messages are transferred

- **Command** is a message sent by the Application to the SDK via MQTT. It's used to control remote logging, push a firmware release, update config variables or any other project specific operation.

- **Report** is a message sent by the SDK to the Application via MQTT & HTTP. It's used for reporting the device status or any other project specific event.
