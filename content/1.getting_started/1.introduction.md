# Introduction

### What is ESP Admin?

**ESP Admin** is an open source platform for remote management of [**Espressif**](https://www.espressif.com) microcontrollers.

Think of it as a web hosting platform but intended for IoT applications.

With a minimal setup, you can use it to

- Deploy firmware updates Over The Air
- Set configuration variables remotely
- Send custom commands
- Collect reports over email & webhooks
- Monitor logs remotely
::

### How It Works?

At a high level, **ESP Admin** comprises a full-stack web **Application** and a firmware **SDK**. It follows an event-driven architecture via MQTT protocol where the **Broker** is user-defined.

Two types of messages are transferred

- **Command** is a message the Application sends to the SDK via MQTT. It's used to control remote logging, push a firmware release, update config variables, or any other project-specific operation.

- **Report** is a message the SDK sends to the Application via MQTT & HTTP. It's used for reporting the device status or any other project-specific event.
