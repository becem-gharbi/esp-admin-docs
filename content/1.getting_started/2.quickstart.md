# Quickstart

The fastest and easiest way to get started is through [**ESP Admin Cloud**](https://app.esp-admin.tn). It's an open and free instance created to better understand and explore the capabilities of the platform.

### Create Account

First you will need to create an account either via email & password or to directly sign in via Google.

### Setup MQTT

Once you have logged in to your account, you can go to **Settings** page and declare your MQTT credentials. You can use for example [**HiveMQ cloud**](https://www.hivemq.com).

The connection to your MQTT broker should be secured

### Create a Device

A device is an ESP based hardware running the SDK. It should be identified by a unique `name` and assigned a secret `API Key` for authorization. Once created, a unique `identifier` or `deviceId` is automatically assigned to it and cannot be changed.

### Create a Project

A project is a way to group devices together. These devices will share the same firmware.

### Link Device to Project

By default the project and the device are unlinked. Link a device to a project allows to set config variables and send commands defined by the project. Furthermore, it allows the deployment of the firmware updates on a new project release.

### Install ESP Admin SDK

::alert{type="info"}
Currently the SDK is distributed on **PlatformIO** registry, works on **Arduino** framework and supports only **espressif32** platform.
::

Clone the provided basic [example](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/bg-dev/ESPAdmin/examples/basic) and install the SDK.

```bash
pio pkg install --library "bg-dev/ESPAdmin"
```
