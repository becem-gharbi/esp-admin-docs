# Usage

Once the application is running, you can start using the SDK.

### Initialization

In `Setup`, first make sure to initialize both the `Serial` communication and the `WiFi` station.

Then you should initialize the SDK

```cpp [main.cpp]
ESPAdmin::begin({
  // Required
  .httpHost = "app.esp-admin.tn",
  .deviceId = "_DEVICE_ID_",
  .apiKey = "_API_KEY_",
  .httpCert = "_HTTP_CERT_",
  .mqttCert = "_MQTT_CERT_",
  // Optional
  .resetDelayMs = 7000,
  .httpMaxResponseSize = 300,
  .httpTimeoutMs = 8000,
  .logMaxMessageSize = 200,
  .mqttTaskPriority = 5,
  .mqttTaskStackSize = 6896,
  .mqttKeepAliveSec = 30,
  .mqttNetworkTimeoutMs = 8000,
  .mqttReconnectTimeoutMs = 10000,
  .otaTaskPriority = 5,
  .otaTaskStackSize = 6896,
});
```

That's it you can now start using the SDK âœ¨

::alert{type="info"}
`httpCert` is the certificate for the application host `httpHost`. `mqttCert` is the CA certificate for the used MQTT broker. Certificates should be in PEM format.
::

### Logging

You can instantiate a `logger` instance of `Logger` class with a custom `scope`.

A `scope` is a way to identify the context from which the `logger` is called. The `logger` has methods for distinct log types `info`, `warn`, `success` and `error`.

::alert{type="info"}
It's recommanded to set `monitor_raw = true` on `platformio.ini` in order to benefit colored logs.
::

The output can be local via `Serial` and remote via `MQTT`. By default, the local logs are enabled and the remote logs are disabled.

::alert{type="info"}
You can disable local logs by setting `Store::logSerialEnabled = false`
::

### Commands

In order to listen for incomming custom commands, you can create a handler and reference it from `Command::onCustom`. The handler accepts a serialized JSON message. You can parse it with [**ArduinoJSON**](https://arduinojson.org) library.

```cpp
void onCustomCommand(String message);

Command::onCustom = &onCustomCommand;
```

### Reports

In order to send custom reports, you can use `Report::send` method.

```cpp
Report::send({
    .type = REPORT_INFO,
    .subject = "Report's subject",
    .body = "Report's body"
  });
```

### Variables

Config variables are accessible via `Store::get(STORE_CONFIG)` in serialized JSON format. You can parse it with [**ArduinoJSON**](https://arduinojson.org) library. To listen for incomming config command, you can create a handler and reference it from `Command::onConfig`.

```cpp
void onConfigCommand(String message);

Command::onConfig = &onConfigCommand;
```

### Updates

Over the air updates are handled internally, performed in non blocking execution and causes software reset on successful deployment.

Updates can be triggered manually via the web application or automatically on a CI pipeline. To build and deploy the release with GitHub Actions:

- Set the GitHub variables and secrets below.
- Add the release workflow below that will be triggered on a new GitHub release.

#### Variables & Secrets

| **Secrets** | **Notes**                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| API_KEY     | The API key of the related project |
| PROJECT_ID  | The ID of the related project      |

| **Variables** | **Notes**                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HOST          | The application's host, e.g. `app.esp-admin.tn`              |
| PIO_ENV       | The PIO environment set on `platformio.ini`, e.g. `esp32dev` |
